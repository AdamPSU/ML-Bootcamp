Despite studying agriculture for 5 years, he doesn't know how to classify the different types of flowers for his client. He needs something that will classify the different flowers for him by using the properties of flowers, since he can't figure it out himself. He called you to help you him out.\n\nHe gave you a dataset that has a bunch of instances of flowers. It can in the form of a .csv file, kind of like an excel spreadsheet. Each row represents a different type of flower, and each column represents a feature of that flower(like petal length, sepal length, etc.). \n\nTrain an Ai to classify the different flowers for your friend John, since he can't even do his own job.    \n\n## Getting started\n\nOpen a Google Collab file through google drive, or just open a jupyter notebook file locally. Typically AI engineers work in notebooks and not normal python files, because it's a lot easier to visualize things that way.\n\nDownload the data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris), and try loading the dataset into the google notebook with Pandas.
